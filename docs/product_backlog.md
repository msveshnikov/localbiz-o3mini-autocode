=========================================== Product Backlog – Small Business ROI Marketing Platform
===========================================

Note: This backlog is continually refined. Items are prioritized from High to Low. Completed or
deprecated items are listed under “Completed/Removed.”

---

1. New Features & User Stories

---

• [High] Chakra UI Integration

- Description: Integrate Chakra UI as the primary UI component library to accelerate development and
  provide a consistent design language.
- Acceptance Criteria:  
  ◦ Chakra Provider is set up in the application.  
  ◦ A few key components (buttons, cards, and forms) are refactored to use Chakra UI.  
  ◦ Documentation updated to reflect new styling practices.

• [High] Responsive & Adaptive Layout Enhancements

- Description: Refine and implement a fully responsive, mobile-first design across the application
  (e.g., landing.html and app pages).
- Acceptance Criteria:  
  ◦ Layout components adjust gracefully on mobile, tablet, and desktop views.  
  ◦ Accessibility standards (contrast, keyboard navigation, etc.) are met.  
  ◦ End-to-end tests for responsive renderings (using tools like Cypress or manual device testing).

• [Medium] Dark Mode and Theme Customization

- Description: Introduce dark mode support and theme customization options to enhance user control
  and experience.
- Acceptance Criteria:  
  ◦ A toggle option for dark/light mode available on the header or settings.  
  ◦ Customizable color schemes via a settings panel.  
  ◦ User preference is stored and re-applied on subsequent visits.

• [Medium] Advanced Analytics Dashboard for Campaign Performance

- Description: Develop an analytics interface that provides detailed ROI and campaign metrics.
- Acceptance Criteria:  
  ◦ Integration with a sample data source to display ROI metrics.  
  ◦ Visualization components (charts, graphs) are integrated or easily swapable.  
  ◦ Dashboard updates in real time or near real time.

• [Medium] State Management Enhancements

- Description: Evaluate and integrate a state management solution (Redux or Context API) to handle
  an increasingly complex application state.
- Acceptance Criteria:  
  ◦ Compare Redux and Context API for current project needs.  
  ◦ Implement a pilot feature (e.g., user authentication or form state) to test chosen state
  management.  
  ◦ Ensure proper documentation for state flows and decision rationale.

• [Low] SEO and Performance Improvements using SSR/SSG

- Description: Explore server-side rendering or static site generation to boost SEO performance and
  decrease initial load times.
- Acceptance Criteria:  
  ◦ Investigate and document the feasibility (e.g., Next.js or Gatsby integration).  
  ◦ Implement a proof-of-concept page with SSR/SSG techniques.  
  ◦ Benchmark improvements against the current client-side rendered approach.

• [Low] Multi-User Role & Collaboration Features

- Description: Build features supporting multiple user roles (admin, marketer, viewer) and
  collaborative marketing efforts.
- Acceptance Criteria:  
  ◦ Define user role permissions and access levels.  
  ◦ Set up a basic user management interface.  
  ◦ Document workflows for collaborative actions.

---

• [High] Responsive Design Implementation (Existing)

- Priority is reaffirmed given the mobile-first approach requirement.

• [Medium] Modular Component Library Development

- Continue refactoring existing components into a reusable library to support scalable marketing
  campaigns.
- Incremental improvements planned alongside new UI integrations.

3. Completed/Removed Items

---

• [Removed] Legacy UI Components:

- Any previous UI components that conflict with the upcoming Chakra UI integration are marked for
  deprecation and removal.

• [Completed] Initial Project Setup

- Basic project setup (file structure, Vite config, and React app entry points) is already in place.

4. Additional Notes & Comments

---

• The backlog items are subject to change as we gather user feedback and further market research.  
• Each feature should have accompanying tests (unit and integration) to ensure long-term project
stability.  
• Regular backlog grooming sessions are recommended to adjust priorities based on development
progress and stakeholder insights.  
• Cross-team collaboration (frontend, backend, and UX/UI designers) is vital—especially for features
like advanced analytics and multi-user roles.  
• Consider future integration with performance monitoring tools to capture real-time analytics for
quick iterations.
