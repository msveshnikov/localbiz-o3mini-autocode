Below is the proposed sprint plan for a two‐week sprint starting on Sat Feb 01 2025.

─────────────────────────────  
Sprint Goal  
─────────────────────────────  
• Deliver a strong foundation for a modern, responsive, and theme‐flexible UI by integrating Chakra
UI and updating key components. This will set the stage for future improvements like advanced
analytics and collaborative features.

─────────────────────────────  
Selected User Stories / Tasks  
─────────────────────────────

1. Chakra UI Integration (High)  
    • Description: Integrate Chakra UI as the primary component library and refactor key UI elements
   (buttons, cards, forms).  
    • Estimated Effort: 8 story points  
    • Acceptance Criteria:  
     - Chakra Provider is configured and wraps the app.  
     - At least three key components are refactored using Chakra UI components.  
     - Documentation is updated to reflect the new styling approach.  
    • Dependencies / Risks:  
     - May conflict with legacy styles if not carefully removed.  
     - Team needs to quickly get up to speed on Chakra UI best practices.

2. Responsive & Adaptive Layout Enhancements (High)  
    • Description: Refine the layout of both landing.html and App pages to ensure a mobile-first,
   responsive design across various devices.  
    • Estimated Effort: 8 story points  
    • Acceptance Criteria:  
     - Layouts adjust gracefully across mobile, tablet, and desktop views.  
     - Accessibility standards are met (contrast, keyboard navigation, etc.).  
     - End-to-end tests (manual or via Cypress) confirm responsiveness.  
    • Dependencies / Risks:  
     - Testing on multiple devices/emulators might reveal edge cases.  
     - Coordination required with UX/UI design to confirm breakpoints and spacing.

3. Dark Mode and Theme Customization (Medium)  
    • Description: Implement a dark mode toggle and customizable theme options, leveraging Chakra
   UI’s theming capabilities.  
    • Estimated Effort: 5 story points  
    • Acceptance Criteria:  
     - A toggle button for dark/light mode is available and functional.  
     - The settings panel lets users switch between predefined color schemes.  
     - User theme preferences persist across sessions (e.g., stored in localStorage).  
    • Dependencies / Risks:  
     - Must be implemented after Chakra UI is integrated.  
     - Risk of visual inconsistencies if custom themes conflict with Chakra defaults.

4. State Management Enhancements (Pilot Implementation) (Medium)  
   • Description: Evaluate the application’s current state flow and pilot a solution using Context
   API to manage a feature’s state (e.g., user authentication or form state).  
   • Estimated Effort: 5 story points  
   • Acceptance Criteria:

    - A small but representative feature is refactored to use Context API.
    - Documentation includes a comparison of Redux versus Context API (decision rationale).
    - Code reviews confirm that the pilot improves maintainability without significant overhead.  
      • Dependencies / Risks:
    - Must coordinate with existing state flows to prevent regressions.
    - Risk of added complexity if the pilot is not modular enough for further expansion.

5. Modular Component Library Refactoring (Medium)  
   • Description: Begin the process of refactoring existing components into a reusable library that
   will ease future development.  
   • Estimated Effort: 3 story points  
   • Acceptance Criteria:
    - Identify and extract at least two common components used in the application into a dedicated
      module/directory.
    - Components are documented and include basic unit tests.  
      • Dependencies / Risks:
    - Must be coordinated with the Chakra UI refactoring effort.
    - Risk of introducing breaking changes if interface contracts are not maintained.

─────────────────────────────  
Dependencies and Risks (Summary)  
─────────────────────────────  
• Chakra UI Integration is a foundation for both theming and component refactoring; delays here can
affect downstream tasks.  
• Responsive design testing requires access to various devices/emulators and might uncover
unexpected layout issues.  
• The pilot state management solution must be isolated enough to avoid ripple effects in existing
functionality.  
• Interdependencies between tasks (e.g., Dark Mode relies on Chakra UI) require careful sequence
planning and communication within the team.

─────────────────────────────  
Definition of Done  
─────────────────────────────  
• All selected user stories pass code reviews and are merged into the main branch with updated
documentation.  
• Key acceptance criteria for each task are met and verified through manual and automated tests.  
• The application demonstrates a Chakra UI–based component structure with a responsive UI and
functioning dark mode/template customization.  
• The pilot for state management enhancements has been successfully deployed in one feature and
documented for the team.  
• No critical regression issues are present in the main codebase as verified by the basic regression
test suite.

─────────────────────────────  
This sprint plan aligns our development efforts with the immediate needs of modernizing the UI while
laying the groundwork for future features. The high-priority tasks will ensure a consistent,
responsive, and customizable user experience for our small business marketing platform.
